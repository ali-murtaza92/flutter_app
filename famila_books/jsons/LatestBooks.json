  "book_description": "<p>The book <span style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;\">Overcoming Challenges by the Word and Praise</span> is a bold and dialectical exposition of the challenges of man in this sinful and wicked world. The author presents the world, after the fall of man, as characterized by the multi-faceted wickedness of the devil. The most potent weapon of the devil is fear. Fear is a hydra-headed weapon of the devil. This is why Job, extremely rich and blessed by God said, \"for the thing which i greatly feared is coming upon me\". An author once wrote that \"fear is the key that opens the wallet of the rich\". The book has however, successfully x-rayed how this fear can be conquered and the devil defeated in the battles of life, through copious reading and understanding of the word of God and praise.</p>",
